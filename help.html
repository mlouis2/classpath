                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally created as a project for RoseHack 2019, classpath is a web-application intended to help
                    college students find the optimal route to get from one building to another on their campus. The project has been continued
                    throughout the Spring 2019 semester under an Honors Research Grant from LMU. Currently, classpath is available for the LMU
                    campus, but we hope to eventually make it compatible for multiple college campuses.
