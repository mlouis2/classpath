# classpath
## summary
If you were to ask yourself who knows the best way around a college campus, the answer would be obvious--it's the students. So, classpath is a tool to take advantage of that knowledge. After a map of a campus is updated, path points can be added to buildings and known walkable paths on a college campus. This allows for students to map their walks from classes, food, community buildings, and more, and determine the best route. Classpath is currently available for Loyola Marymount University.

This project was built for Rose Hack 2019 by Maddie Louis (Computer Science), Megan West (Computer Engineering), Kaitlyn Behrens (Animation), and Shauna Sapper (Mathematics - Computer Science).
## features
- a custom JavaScript graph, which can be used to calculate how to get from one vertex (building) to another
- a fun and inviting UI featuring original art by Kaitlyn Behrens
- a customizable amount of classes, from 2-5, that are color coded so that the user can tell the direction and order of their path
## future goals
- we would like to be able to implement time so that students can also get an estimate of how long their classpath will take to walk
- we would like to expand this to other campuses by creating a custom data structure that allows students to upload maps with points of interest for their own campuses, so that classpath has a reach beyond LMU
- we would like to implement bike-specific paths, particularly for larger campuses
