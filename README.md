# classpath
If you were to ask yourself who knows the best way around a college campus, the answer would be obvious--it's the students. So, classpath is a tool to take advantage of that knowledge. After a map of a campus is updated, path points can be added to buildings and known walkable paths on a college campus. This allows for students to map their walks from classes, food, community buildings, and more, and determine the best route. Classpath is currently available for Loyola Marymount University.
This project was built for Rose Hack 2019 by Maddie Louis, Megan West, Kaitlyn Behrens, and Shauna Sapper.
